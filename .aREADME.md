# RAW To VIS


### About

**RAW to VIS** is a fork of the **RAW** open web tool developed at the [DensityDesign Research Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org) (Politecnico di Milano) to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) library by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/).

**RAW to VIS** simply adds requireJS to the **RAW** framework to easily allow better separation of concerns and dependency managment.  Please see the **[official RAW page](https://github.com/densitydesign/raw)** for more details on usage, installation, requirements, etc.

I have placed a pull request to the RAW project, but until it's accepted; I'll use this fork as a jumping off point for other projects that want to customize the look, feel, and any specific visualizations.
